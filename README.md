Qutie is my own collection of dotfiles designed exclusively for Mac OS X. They intend to make my life on the console much more productive and above all
else a lot prettier to look at.

This repository is heavily based on Yan Pritzker's [YADR](https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles).

Installation
------------

Installation is automated via rake and the qutie command. To get started please run:

    sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/3miliano/qutie/master/install.sh`"

Note: Qutie will automatically install all of its subcomponents. If you want to be asked about each one, use:

    sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/3miliano/qutie/master/install.sh`" -s ask
